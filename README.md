# Sorting-compressed-time-series

This is the repository for Compressed-Sort algorithm. 

The evaluation code is based on IoTDB.

## File Structure
+ `iotdb/`: include the scripts and database used for evaluations
    + `OrderSensitiveTimeEncoder&OrderSensitiveValueEncoder`: the encoding method proposed in the paper
    + `CompressedBubbleSorter`: the compressed bubble sort algorithm proposed in the paper
    + `CompressedMergeSorter`: the compressed merge sort algorithm proposed in the paper
+ `tsfile/`: show the compressed-sort operator implemented for this file format
    + `TsFileSorter`: the operator for compressed-bubble sort
    + `UnsortedFileGenerator`: generate a file containing unordered data by specifying the dataset
    + `SortTest`: test the compressed sort operator
+ `datasets/`: include all the public datasets used for evaluations
    + `Samsung`: This dataset is generated using standard commercial protocols, networks, and devices commonly found in IoT applications, corresponding to several real-world usage scenarios.
    + `CarNet`: This is a vehicle dataset from our industrial partner that contains data from over 7 million vehicles of a specific brand during real-world operation, totaling over 200 million time series. 
    + `ShipNet`: This dataset, obtained from the U.S. Coast Guardâ€™s AIS network, contains historical vessel traffic data. It includes information on vessel location, time, and characteristics, and is formatted for analysis in geographic information system software.
    + `Exponential`: This is an artificial dataset in which we use 1 as the time interval of occurrence and an exponential distribution with a parameter of 1 to simulate delays in the time transmission process. For the value column, we generated random values uniformly distributed between -100 and 100.
